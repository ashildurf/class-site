	<h1> Still life with sea pinks and high tide </h1>
  	
  	<p> 

  	Thrift grows tenacious at the tide’s reach. <br>
	What is that reach when the water <br>
	is rising, rising? <br>
		<br>
	Our melting, shifting, liquid world won’t wait <br>
	for manifesto or mandate, each <br>
	warning a reckoning.  <br>
	<br>
	Ice in our gin or vodka chirrups and squeaks <br>
	dissolving in the hot, still air <br>
	of talking, talking. <br>

			<h1>Nostalgia</h1>

			<p>
			I miss when I could drop down on all fours
			and flick the ground away from under me. <br>
			I miss the wire I ran into the earth. <br>
			I miss when I was the bloom on the sea <br>
			and we slept forever under the warm clouds <br>
			till something twitched with design <br>
			and woke the clock. So we arose and went. <br>
			<br>
			Last night when the waters rose again
			I rowed out to the beeless glade
			and lay down on the grass. My sister
			taught me to watch the stars this way
			lest I think that heaven was up, or heaven,
			lest I forget the stars are also below us
			where they sink and sail into the dark like cinders.
