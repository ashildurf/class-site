Only when our computers storage is full do we start looking over what we are storing and how to get rid of it. <br> <br>

The longer we have our computers, the more folders and subfolders we have. When we are forced to look into these folders, we realize that many of our files we barely use and some we might not even know we had. Are containers a way of procrastination?
